# SentialFlow
SentinelFlow quietly reduces alert noise by turning raw signals into instant priority decisions — so humans spend focus only where impact truly matters.

SOC teams face massive alert volume, but most alerts are noise. Analysts still open each alert, enrich it, and make a small judgement call: ignore or investigate? That single “first-filter” step wastes most analyst time, not the deep investigation. Playbooks automate steps, but not thinking. When patterns shift, static rules fail, and real threats get buried behind harmless signals.

We need a faster way to score and prioritise alerts before humans touch the queue — without exposing model internals, without sending data to cloud inference, and without revealing our exact decision logic.

We are not replacing SIEM or detection.
We are removing the wasted time between alert generated → alert worth caring about — quietly, like testing an F1 prototype on a closed track: people see the lap time, but not the engine
